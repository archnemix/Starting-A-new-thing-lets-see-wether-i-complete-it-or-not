# Docs: Changelog

> Purpose: what each version shipped, and what changed between versions - added,
> removed, replaced. Concise, but complete per release.

Version numbering: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. While the format and API are unstable the
MAJOR stays `0`. The container format has its own `format_major.minor` recorded in
every file.

## Unreleased (design phase)

No code yet. This stage produced documentation only:

- Added the full doc set (`Docs/`, `Plan/`), repository skeleton, folder READMEs.
- Added research log with verified hook/API facts (`Docs/Research.json`).
- Added CI spine: trigger-file-driven workflow that commits results into the repo.
  Verified end to end: GitHub run `43052619656`, three runners (ubuntu, windows,
  macos) green, each committing `Actions/out/latest-env/<os>.json` back to the branch.
- Decided: Python core instead of a Rust core (no Rust toolchain reachable; the
  brief's requirement was "must work in Python").
- Decided: the product is a **recording triple** (state + cause + stage), not a storage
  format (Architecture 6.0).
- Decided: training data is **stored by default** (`data_level=segments`), deduplicated and
  content-addressed, opt-out recorded; the brief's "fingerprints only" is superseded.
- Format: `DATA_SEGMENT`, `DATA_SHARD`, `DATA_POINTER` block types; `data_level`,
  `attribution`, `base_model`, `ancestor` in META.
- Added claims 11-14 (dedup, codecs, data overhead, join round-trip) to the measurement list.

## v0.1.0 - not released

Planned contents: docs scaffold, CI spine, packaging skeleton, test-record system
(Roadmap Phase 0).
