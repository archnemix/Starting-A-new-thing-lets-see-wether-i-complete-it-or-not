# Docs: Changelog

> Purpose: what each version shipped, and what changed between versions - added,
> removed, replaced. Concise, but complete per release.

Version numbering: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. While the format and API are unstable the
MAJOR stays `0`. The container format has its own `format_major.minor` recorded in
every file.

## Unreleased (design phase)

No code yet. This stage produced documentation only:

- Added the full doc set (`Docs/`, `Plan/`), repository skeleton, folder READMEs.
- Added research log with verified hook/API facts (`Docs/Research.json`).
- Added CI spine: trigger-file-driven workflow that commits results into the repo.
  Verified end to end: GitHub run `43052619656`, three runners (ubuntu, windows,
  macos) green, each committing `Actions/out/latest-env/<os>.json` back to the branch.
- Decided: Python core instead of a Rust core (no Rust toolchain reachable; the
  brief's requirement was "must work in Python").
- Decided: the product is a **recording triple** (state + cause + stage), not a storage
  format (Architecture 6.0).
- Decided: training data is **stored by default** (`data_level=segments`), deduplicated and
  content-addressed, opt-out recorded; the brief's "fingerprints only" is superseded.
- Format: `DATA_SEGMENT`, `DATA_SHARD`, `DATA_POINTER` block types; `data_level`,
  `attribution`, `base_model`, `ancestor` in META.
- Added claims 11-14 (dedup, codecs, data overhead, join round-trip) to the measurement list.
- Naming decided: PyPI distribution `archx.mdl` (normalises to `archx-mdl`), import and CLI
  stay `archx`, npm `archx` reserved as a signpost package. No cap on stored data by default.

## v0.1.0 - not released yet (Phase 0 and Phase 1 complete on the branch)

Shipped on the branch:

- Packaging: distribution `archx.mdl`, import `archx`, CLI `archx`, MIT, Python >= 3.10.
- Container format 1.0: 40-byte header, 28-byte block prefix (step inside), JSON/binary
  payloads, zstd or zlib per block, INDEX block, 56-byte footer, CRC everywhere.
- Append-only `Writer` with batched fsync and CLOSED flag.
- Validating `Reader`: refuses foreign files, newer majors, absurd lengths, bad CRCs; skips
  unknown block types; reports torn tails.
- `archx recover`: keeps whole blocks, truncates the tail, rebuilds the index from prefixes
  (no decompression), writes a footer, sets RECOVERED.
- `archx info` and `archx recover` commands, human and `--json` output.
- 31 tests (unit + integration + property), green on Linux, Windows and macOS.
- CI writes machine-readable run records into `Actions/out/test-runs/`.

Planned for the same version: delta encoders and the compression benchmarks (Phase 2).
